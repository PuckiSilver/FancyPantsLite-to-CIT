# FancyPantsLite-to-CIT
Drag [FancyPantsLite](https://github.com/PuckiSilver/FancyPantsLite) textures onto this program to **convert them into the CIT format**

## How to convert the Texture
0. Have [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Pillow](https://pillow.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) installed and download [the python program](FancyPantsLite-to-CIT.py)
   - If you have python installed, you can just run `pip install pillow` in a terminal to install Pillow
2. **Select both** of your armor textures (`leather_layer_1` and `leather_layer_2`) in the [FancyPantsLite](https://github.com/PuckiSilver/FancyPantsLite) format
   - They have to be in an **unzipped** resource pack
3. **Drag** the two files **onto** [the .py file](FancyPantsLite-to-CIT.py)

Then it will **create all required files** in the `assets/minecraft/optifine/cit/fancypantslite` folder and your resource pack **now works with CIT and vanilla**

## How to use in-game
Make sure that you have either [Optifine](https://optifine.net/downloads) or [CIT Resewn](https://modrinth.com/mod/cit-resewn/version/latest) installed, then you can **always see the custom armor textures**, even **with modded shaders active**
> **Note**: The resource pack will still work with vanilla- and lightly modded minecraft, even **without** these mods installed
